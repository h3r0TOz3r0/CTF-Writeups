# What You Need To Follow

Nothing but I did this on Windows.

# Write Up:

So lets look at the source code...

First thing to note, it POSTs "debug" but doesn't initialize it. So lets set that to 1 in order to see what's happening.

Right click the LOGIN button, select "Inspect" and find the debug. Change 0 to 1.

Now we can at least see what we're typing but still no cigar. Through trial-and-error, I realized the typical ' or '1-- doesn't work...

So. There's another way we can OR something, we use "union".

So finally, I used ' union select 1 from users-- and got the Flag.
